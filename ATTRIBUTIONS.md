# Wasmer Attributions

Wasmer is a community effort.
In order to build the best WebAssembly runtime it's our duty to see how other runtimes are approaching the same space
and get inspired from them on the things that they got right, so wasmer and it's community can benefit from a solid
foundation.

This are the different project that we used as inspiration:

- [Nebulet](https://github.com/nebulet/nebulet): as the base for creating a great Rust WebAssembly runtime
- [WAVM](https://github.com/wavm/wavm): for their great integration and testing framework
- [greenwasm](https://github.com/Kimundi/greenwasm): for their [spectests framework](https://github.com/Kimundi/greenwasm/tree/master/greenwasm-spectest)
- [wasmtime](/wasmtime): on their [mmap implementation](https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime/blob/3f24098edc81cd9bf0f877fb7fba018cad0f039e/lib/runtime/src/mmap.rs).
- [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45795699/1072990): to create an efficient HashMap with pair keys.

We would love to hear from you if you think we should be inspired by other codes/repos we haven't covered here.
